## The Challenge

The FinTech industry is really hot right now. Mark Erbergzuck realizes that he spends a lot of money on different purchases and would benefit from automatically summarizing his expenses. He receives monthly statements from his bank, but he finds them a bit overwhelming. He has tasked you with developing a piece of software that will automate the processing of his bank statements so he can get better insights into his finances. Challenge accepted!

## The Goal

Learning the foundations about good software development before learning more advanced techniques in the next few chapters.

### **Single Responsibility Principle**: The Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) is a general software development guideline to follow that contributes to writing code that is easier to manage and maintain.

- A class has responsibility over a single functionality
- There is only one single reason for a class to change.

### **KISS Principle**: Keep It Short and Simple.

### **God Class**: Putting all of your code in one file, you end up with one giant class making it harder to understand its purpose because that class is responsible for everything.

### **Code Duplication**: Duplicating a certain logic, hardcoding it in multiple places.

### **DRY**: Don't Repeat Yourself.
